# 💥 Dashhole

### Because em dashes are pretentious - and you're not.

**Dashhole** is a Chrome extension that hunts down every em dash (—) on ChatGPT and replaces it with a good ol' humble hyphen (-).  
No drama. No flair. Just straight-shootin’ punctuation.

> ✂️ _"One small dash for man, one giant leap for clarity."_ — You, after installing this
